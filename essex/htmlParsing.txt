Udo Kruschwitz - Research Information



 

Research Interests
I am a member of the  Language and
Computation Group (LAC) here at Essex  (most recent  17th LAC
    Day: 21st September 2018; earlier 
  events: 16th
    LAC Day 2017, 15th
    LAC Day 2016, 14th
    LAC Day 2015, 13th
    LAC Day 2014, 12th
    LAC Day 2013, 11th LAC Day 2012,
10th LAC Day 2011).
 Check out the programme of our LAC Reading Group.









My research interests are in natural language processing (NLP), information
retrieval (IR) and the implementation of such techniques in real
applications. The intelligent
directory enquiry assistant (YPA) project is an example (going back quite a
  few years now ...) where the
extraction of information from partially structured data together with
engineering issues played major roles in making the YPA a usable online
system. 
I am developing techniques that allow the extraction of
conceptual information from document collections and the utilization of
such knowledge in retrieval tasks. The type of documents can range from Web
pages to newspaper articles or other forms of vaguely/partially structured
  data. For an example application that we had in place with BT's mobile
  workforce have a look at our log analysis study.


Current Projects / Ongoing Collaboration


  
A five-year ESRC Large Grant on Human Rights in the Era of Big Data
is now well underway. The
Language and Computation Group (Fox/Poesio/Kruschwitz) plays a
significant role in this project which also builds on our links with 
the Minority Rights Group. Watch
this space!


  
A
Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT)
on Intelligent Games and Game  Intelligence
  (IGGI)  offering 55 PhD student scholarships over 8 years is being funded
by the EPSRC and supported by our 60 industrial partners. To find out more

explore our students' profiles! The CDT involves the University of York, the University of Essex, Queen Mary,  University of London, 
and Goldsmiths College, University of London. If you want to know more, drop me
an email! 

  

  
A
three-year Knowledge
  Transfer Partnership (KTP) project (2014-2017) involving
the Minority Rights Group and
Essex (Poesio/Kruschwitz) aimed at new systems to
support civilian-led monitoring of human-rights violations. 
The Iraq Ceasefire Portal is one of the major outcomes of the project.

The Corpus of Violence Acts in Arabic Social Media is an academic resource, described in more detail in our LREC 2016 paper.

  

A highly successful

Knowledge
  Transfer Partnership (KTP) project (2013-2015) was the starting point for an
ongoing collaboration with Signal Media. As
the University Lead PI I am pleased
that Miguel
	Martinez-Alvarez who joined us as KTP Associate is now Head of
Research at Signal. Here is a timeline of some exciting news in our collaboration:

    
November 2014: Miguel is named a Business
  Leader of Tomorrow (here is a
  short video
  portrait of Miguel ... and more coverage of the event / main
  actors here).
April 2015:  Best demo award at ECIR 2015
for Signal demo, and even more exciting: Signal has just announced that it has
raised $1.8m growth capital from top tier investors (see
Techcrunch).
November 2015: Signal project wins Best KTP
Partnership Award 2015.
 February 2016: Project features on
      InnovateUK's
	home page again.
 Another landmark: Signal closes a $16m  

      Series B funding round.
      
 December 2018: new KTP project confirmed, to start in January 2019.
    

  

    Creating anaphorically annotated resources through semantic wikis (AnaWiki)
    (EPSRC) This project has led to the development of Phrase Detectives, an
    annotation game  aimed at the creation of semantically annotated corpora. 


    The DALI project builds on the findings and lessons learned in PhraseDetectives.

   

    
Recent Research/Development Projects


  
The SENSEI FP7
  project started in November 2013 and finished in November 2016. The one-line aim of the project is to make sense
of human-human conversation by, for example, applying advanced natural-language
engineering techniques such as anaphora resolution and multi-document
summarization.
Read about the use of SENSEI technology to predict the Brexit results, or if you prefer to read articles in Polish, have a look at this one.



  
   
    Automatic Adaptation of Knowledge Structures for Assisted Information Seeking (AutoAdapt), a project involving the
    School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Robert
    Gordon University Aberdeen and the Open
    University. 

    This project developed and evaluated methods for adapting automatically
    constructed domain models to the population of users' search or browsing
    behaviour. Application and large-scale evaluation of the developed methods in
    two information seeking scenarios - namely, interactive search and browsing -
      were the focus of this project.



PEBL-AI is a project that follows on from the Patient Experience and
Public Engagement Blogs (PEBL) project. PEBL-AI will result in an automated
interface
between clinical commissioner groups (CCGs) and the communities they serve. 

  

    
    Development of a career path framework, a KTP project involving the
    School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering and JobServe, the world's first
    Internet Recruitment Service.   


    
    Development of an  intelligent mail server, a KTP project involving the
    School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering and Active Web Solutions (AWS), an Ipswich based
    company devoted to cutting edge enterprise information systems.
